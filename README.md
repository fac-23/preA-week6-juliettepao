# APIs application - week 6 - Juliette & Paolo

## User Stories

### As a user I want to:

* See an interesting mashup of different data.
* Input information to change the displayed result.
* View the app on all of my devices.

## Stretch User Stories
- [x] Visual feedback of data loading.
- [x] Visual feedback on errors.

## Custom User stories

### As a user interested in travel I want to:

* Be able to pick a city.
* Visualise photos of that city.
* Visualise the current weather in that city.
* Get news articles related to the city or country.


## Acceptance criteria
* Decide on 2 APIs and use fetch
* Generate HTML content dynamically from the response.
* Document the user journey in your README file.
* Responsive design.
* Accessibility.

## Initial Ideas
* App related to travelling / countries / food
* App related to movies and relevant GIF
* Start with an input field, if we figure it out quickly we could make it more complex, more options using radio inputs.

## Potential issues
* Built an initial, simple HTML / CSS frame for the app to be able to visualize the data we fetch form the APIs
  * Header title 
  * Input field
  * Two divs to visualize data from the 2 APIs
  * Button to send request
  * Div to visualize errors

* Styling of the app.
  
* Final responsiveness check.

* Final accessibility check.
